# Horiseon Challange 
challenge for week one that which I had to debug a website and make the website more accessible. 
I chose my own names for the html and css files. the html file will be under 
challange1.html and the css style sheet will be under the challenge1.css sheet. I did this so I could just be a bit more organized.

In this scenerio I was making the company of Horiseons site more accessible. Following the format of "AS AN / I WANT / SO THAT ". To complete the following tasts that were...

"GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title "  

Using the html file and css files I then corrected the coding to make sure that the following website had and showed that.

Changes that I made to improve and make more accessible were...
- Changing some of the <div> elements to better state the categories we were in.
- Added alt tags to all images so the viewer can read the tag just in case the photo didn't go through.
- Added more notes in html and css pages for more of an organizable approch.
- Changed elements in the css sheet in order to make the header look more well done
- Changed the image links to link to the current photo 
- Changed the title of the tab name tio the name of the company so it better represents the company. 
- Organize the html structure and make sure its all in semantic order.
